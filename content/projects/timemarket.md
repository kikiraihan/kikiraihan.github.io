### Brief :
Workload management applications such as human resource management are needed to be included in the BI Innovation program. The application aims to facilitate the delegation of work accurately, for the purpose of efficiency in managing and monitoring employee work, as well as limiting the number of employee jobs that are considered reasonable.
Applications must be accessible from anywhere, and easy to use.

**Working time :** 2 months (tetantive) + maintenance

**Date :** May â€“ October 2021

### Solution :
To solve the problems in the brief, the following solutions are given:
- Interactive UI using livewire, to facilitate users and support development speed
- Design the interface with the principle of mobile first development, so that application responsiveness to desktop and smartphone devices can be fulfilled
- Added native access mode feature via chrome browser by adding certain metadata to the main HTML page. So that web applications can be opened as if they were native android applications (Semi Progressive Web App).
- Manual Book Creation

The application can be accessed via the [following link](https://timemarket.enter.id). this is a Human Resource Management application that aims to monitor and control the workload of employees based on time management and human resources so that they are balanced in order to achieve targets efficiently and effectively.
