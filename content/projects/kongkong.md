# Kongkong Student Crowdfunding Platform (Practice Project)

### Brief :
We plan to develop a crowdfunding platform for student activities, the idea is to provide an alternative source of funding for students who want to carry out activities instead of having to run a list of funds per person, without explaining activity information.

My task is to make the appearance of the application match the target student user. It takes a display that is flexible as well as responsive. Displays data on student and ormawa activities that carry out activities.


### Solution :
Created a view using bootstrap from scratch without using a template. Made with mobile first development principles, to support display responsiveness on smartphone devices that are commonly used by students.
