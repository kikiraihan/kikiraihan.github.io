# PT. MAKASSAR RAYA MOTOR: Optimizing Sales Strategies through Spatial Analysis

**üîó URL:** : [Client Profile](https://daihatsumrm.co.id/) <br> 
**‚è±Ô∏è Working Period:** October 2023 - June 2024 <br> 

### Brief :
PT. Makassar Raya Motor is a prominent Daihatsu dealer company based in Makassar, Indonesia, with a strong presence across South Sulawesi, Central Sulawesi, and Southeast Sulawesi. With 10 branches strategically located across these provinces, the company sought to enhance its sales strategies through data-driven insights. As a Software Engineer & Data Analyst under contract, our role was pivotal in conducting spatial analysis of sales data and developing a comprehensive dashboard to visualize key metrics.

### Solution :
In this project we focused on leveraging spatial analysis techniques and developing data visualization tools to optimize sales strategies. The following outlines our key contributions:

- Spatial Analysis of Sales Data: We conducted extensive spatial analysis of sales data covering 3 provinces, 54 districts, 709 sub-districts, and 7,394 villages. By dissecting sales performance at various geographic levels, we gained valuable insights into market trends, customer demographics, and demand patterns across different regions.

- Collaboration with Spatial Mapping Team: Working closely with urban planning experts, we collaborated on designing detailed maps for each region within the 3 provinces. These maps incorporated essential socio-economic indicators such as GDP, Per Capita Income, population statistics, sourced from the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS). This collaborative effort ensured that our analysis was grounded in comprehensive spatial data.

- Development of Dashboard using Python Plotly: Utilizing Python Plotly, we developed an interactive dashboard to visualize the results of our spatial analysis. The dashboard provided dynamic maps of the 3 provinces, 54 districts, and 709 sub-districts, allowing stakeholders to explore sales performance metrics and socio-economic indicators at a glance. This user-friendly interface facilitated informed decision-making for sales and marketing strategies.

- Fullstack Web App with Laravel Livewire: We built a frontend Web App using Laravel Livewire, integrating the interactive dashboard seamlessly into the user interface. This fullstack application provided a unified platform for accessing sales data, conducting spatial analysis, and visualizing results in real-time, enhancing efficiency and accessibility for stakeholders.

- Backend Development with FastAPI Python: Complementing the frontend application, we developed a backend system using FastAPI Python for processing spatial data and powering the mapping functionalities. This backend infrastructure ensured robust performance and scalability, enabling efficient data management and analysis.


Achievements:
- Conducted comprehensive spatial analysis of sales data across 3 provinces, providing actionable insights for sales strategies.
- Collaborated with urban planning experts to design detailed maps incorporating socio-economic indicators for accurate analysis.
- Developed an interactive dashboard using Python Plotly, enabling stakeholders to visualize sales performance and socio-economic metrics.
- Built a fullstack Web App with Laravel Livewire, integrating the dashboard seamlessly for user-friendly access to data and analysis tools.
- Implemented a backend system with FastAPI Python for efficient processing of spatial data and mapping functionalities.
