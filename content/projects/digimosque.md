# Digimosque: making API and admin panels for digital mosque android applications"

### Brief :
Digimosque is a startup that carries a digital mosque platform that can make it easier to find information on mosques in the area and also as a place to make donations for religious activities. This application provides information on mosques around us, takmir features for cash/infaq/qurban management etc., IOT tools (monitors, air conditioners, prayer times, etc.) that are directly integrated with the application, and various other features.

The developers recruited me and 2 of my other friends, to help build an API for data access from the server to their android application (prototype), besides that they also needed an admin panel on the web platform, to be used by application administrators in managing mosque data, Access for IOT Tools, Takmir user verification, etc.

**Working time:** 2 months

**Date :** March â€“ May 2022

### Solution :
To solve the problem in the brief given the following solutions:
- I helped advise during meetings on redesigning the database at the direction of the product manager, to adapt to new features. We did reverse engineering, so we still use the old data in the hope that it will make a few adjustments.
- I helped in making an API for **algorithm for finding nearby mosques** and several other APIs.
- I was also assigned to handle **the entire creation of the admin panel** (but still with the help of the team if an error occurs on the deployment side) by using **livewire** to accelerate the project because the deadline is approaching. I use **Livewire** because it helps me design, organize, and reuse web components that have been created, thus **speeding up admin website creation**.

This digimosque application is already available on PlayStore for Android or can be downloaded via [this link](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=digimosque&c=apps)
