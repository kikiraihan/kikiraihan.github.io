### Solution :
During our engagement with Contag School, we focused on delivering robust backend solutions to support their SaaS products. The following highlights summarize our contributions:

- API Module Development: We spearheaded the development of more than 20 API modules tailored to Contag School's specific requirements. These modules facilitated seamless communication between different components of the software ecosystem, enabling efficient data exchange and workflow automation.

- Version Control Management: Throughout the project, we maintained an active presence on GitHub, where we logged over 800 commits. This disciplined approach to version control ensured that our codebase remained organized, accessible, and continuously updated with new features and bug fixes.

- Adherence to SOLID Principles: We adhered to SOLID principles while crafting backend program code. By prioritizing concepts such as Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion, we ensured that our codebase was modular, maintainable, and extensible, laying a solid foundation for future development efforts.

- NestJS Framework Implementation: Leveraging the power and flexibility of the NestJS JavaScript framework, we built scalable and performant backend solutions for Contag School's SaaS products. NestJS provided a robust architectural framework, along with built-in support for TypeScript, dependency injection, and modularization, which expedited development and enhanced code quality.

- Clean Code Practices: We embraced clean code principles throughout the development lifecycle, emphasizing readability, maintainability, and scalability. By writing self-explanatory code, adhering to consistent coding styles, and employing meaningful naming conventions, we aimed to simplify code comprehension and facilitate collaborative development within the Contag School team.
